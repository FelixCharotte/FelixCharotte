### Hi there 👋

# About ME
Here is what is worth knowing about me, in 2 minutes top chrono! ⏱️

## 🔭 I'm a 2nd year student
... at _Audencia Business School_ and _Centrale Nantes_ following the **Bachelor of Business Admistration** (BBA) specialized in _Big Data_ & _Management_. A lot of topics are covered in this degree but the one I'm slowly falling in love with is **Machine Learning**.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot
Here is the link of all the [topics](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/study/undergraduate/bba-data-ai-management-1?l=1) covered by this degree for intrested ones. I am also working on some cool data science projects like Sentiment Analysis for trading strategies, Churn Prediction, Data Cleansing with 45+ variables, and House Price Prediction using Scikit-learn, deployed via Flask on AWS. Here you can find my [Portfolio Website](https://charottefelix.wixsite.com/maker) with more Data Viz and marketing projects and let you discover the data science and ML side here on GitHub!

## 🧑‍💻 Professional side
Alongside my studies, I offer occasional Marketing & Business Intelligence services for VINCI Construction and some SMEs. And working actually on AI chatbot agency for schools called ConversIA. A few years ago, I pivoted from a pure business track to something more tech-focused, and it’s been an exciting shift!

Right now, I’m actively looking for internships and opportunities in data science and machine learning so do not hesitate to ask anything!

## ⚡ Other & Fun facts
My personal motto? If you can dream it, you can do it! It’s been a little reminder since day one, and it keeps me motivated and looking forward to the next steps!
Always dare and try we are like in a game building our story.
