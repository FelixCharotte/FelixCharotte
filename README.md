### Hi there 👋

# About ME
Here is what is worth knowing about me.

## 🔭 I'm a 2nd year student
... at _Audencia Business School_ and _Centrale Nantes_ following the **Bachelor of Business Admistration** (BBA) specialized in _Big Data_ & _Management_. A lot of topics are covered in this degree but the one I'm slowly falling in love with is **Machine Learning**.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot
Here is the link of all the [topics](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/study/undergraduate/bba-data-ai-management-1?l=1) covered by this degree for intrested ones. I am also starting the [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit0/introduction) course made by Hugging Face, it looks like magic to me and who's never wanted to be a wizard ?! There are a lot of side projects, I hope to build a website soon to showcase them properly and hope to render everything I can available here on GitHub.

## 🧑‍💻 Professional side
Aside from school, I offer occasional Marketing & Business Intelligence services for VINCI Construction and some SMEs. And working actually on AI chatbot agency for schools called ConversIA. A few years ago, I pivoted from a pure business track to something more tech-focused, and it’s been an exciting shift!

Alongside my studies, I offer occasional Marketing & Business Intelligence projects for VINCI Construction and some SMEs. I’m also working with a classmate on an AI chatbot agency project aimed at enhancing student experience at business schools.

Right now, I’m actively looking for internships and opportunities in data science and machine learning.

## ⚡ Other & Fun facts
My personal motto? If you can dream it, you can do it! It’s been a little reminder since day one, and it keeps me motivated and looking forward to the next steps!
